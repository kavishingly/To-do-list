TEMPLATES:
templates are use to avoid making several html files for each responses
they help to manipulate a particular part of code
view folder: the ejs file must be saved in a view folder

tags: scriplet tag <% %> :every js code should be inside scriplet

marker tag <%= var %> : every var should be inside this tag
this tells the file to replace whatever inside here with variable
it helps to send variable to markup ie html and use control flow(ie loops if else)
